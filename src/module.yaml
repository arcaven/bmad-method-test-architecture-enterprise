      Stack Auto-Detection:
        TEA will detect your project type from manifest files:
        - Frontend: package.json with react/vue/angular, playwright.config.*, vite.config.*
        - Backend: pyproject.toml, pom.xml, go.mod, *.csproj, Gemfile, Cargo.toml
        - Full-stack: both frontend and backend indicators present
        Existing installations without test_stack_type default to "auto" (detects frontend).
  ci_platform:
    auto: |
      CI Platform Auto-Detection:
        TEA will detect your CI platform from repository files:
        - GitHub Actions: .github/workflows/
        - GitLab CI: .gitlab-ci.yml
        - Jenkins: Jenkinsfile
        - Azure DevOps: azure-pipelines.yml
        - Harness: .harness/
        - CircleCI: .circleci/config.yml
        Existing installations without ci_platform default to "auto".

      Pact.js Utils Setup:
        npm install -D @seontechnologies/pactjs-utils
        Peer dependency: @pact-foundation/pact >= 16.2.0
          npm install -D @pact-foundation/pact
        For remote flow (with Pact Broker):
          Set PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL and PACT_BROKER_TOKEN as env vars or CI secrets.
          Also set GITHUB_SHA (auto-set by GitHub Actions) and GITHUB_BRANCH (must be defined explicitly: ${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}).
        For local flow (monorepo):
          No broker needed - consumer generates pacts, provider verifies locally.
